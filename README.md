# Python for Data Anlysis - Project
## Auto Exploratory Data Analysis of Financial Instruments

## Description

### Aim
This project aims to automatically perform an EDA independent to the type of the financial instrument

### Data
In the prospect of testing, AAPL and NOK stocks are used plus BNB-USD, BTC-USD, and ETH-USD crypto is used.

# Pipeline

1. Download the data and store it inside the "inputs" directory.
2. Open `01_Executor.ipynb` 
3. Fill in the Parameters mentioned in `01_Executor.ipynb`
4. Run `01_Executor.ipynb`
5. The result will now be stored as an ipython notebook in the `outputs` directory
6. Download the result as an html and enjoy the analysis

## Project structure

- `01_Executor.ipynb` - defining directory paths and relevant parameters.
- `inputs` - input data files.
- `outputs` - contains the .ipynb files generated after the generation of automated templates.
- `templates` - used to generate the outputs for the given inputs. 
- `requirements.txt` - requirements file to run the code.
